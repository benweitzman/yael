Yael is an effect system that models effects as records. This module
contains the core functionality needed to define and use effects.

In Yael, each effect is a record, paremeterized by a `Monad`, `m`. For example

@
data MyEffect m = MyEffect
  { _myMethod1 :: String -> m Bool
  , _myMethod2 :: m Int -> m [Int]
  }
@

Each field in an effect record is a "method" of that effect. Methods after often
functions, but they don't have to be. They can be of the form `m a` for some `a`, or
they can simply not refer to `m` at all. As seen in `MyEffect`, methods can be
first-order, meaning that `m` only appears in the result of a functional method, or
they can be higher order, meaning that `m` appears in the arguments of a functional
method. Most methods are first-order, but higher-order methods are useful to represent
effects that can wrap other effectful code, for example when working with transactional
data

-- | Lift a first-order computation that is expressible wholly through `g` into `EffT`.
-- This is most commonly used to define convient method accessors generically in

--
-- Returning to the `MyEffect` example above, we'll see that `_myMethod1` has type
-- @MyEffect m -> String -> m Bool@. The @MyEffect m@ paremeter is cumbersome to
-- work with, so we can use `withEffT`:

-- | Lift a higher-order computation in `g` into `EffT`.
--
-- `withEffT'` is similar to `withEffT`, but it provides an additional "lowering"
-- function that is useful for working with higher order computations. For example
--
-- @
-- myMethod2 :: (HasEff MyEffect f m) => EffT f m Int -> EffT f m [Int]
-- myMethod2 m = withEffT' $ \lower myEffect -> _myMethod2 myEffect (lower m)
